### Today's Topic:-
* Data Science + Cloud

**Facts:-**
* 80% worldwide data is business oriented
* 15 PB is daily data generated by Facebook which is fact of 2 years ago

# **Big Data Hadoop**
## **Big Data**
```Big Data``` means Huge amount of data
* Bigdata is a problem

**Problems:-**
* Store:-
    * Where to Store ?
    * How to Store ?
        * We need Speed and Size
* How to Process it ?
* How to make Business with it ?

```IO Rate``` - Combination of Read and Write speed of HDD
* Between 2 devices in which we are tranferring, lowest speed is applicable in that tranfer.

---
## **Hadoop**
```Hadoop``` is a technology/framework which solves all the problems og BigData

Creators of Hadoop in different ways:-
* Apache [FREE and for learning]
* Cloudera [As a student, not for learning]
* Hortonworks [NOT FREE]

### **Apache Hadoop**
* v1
* v2 [Currently working in v2.7 and RedHat 7.5]
* v3 [Recent and Latest]

**Hadoop Framework/Platform**


* Storage
    * ```HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)``` - A Component which stores the data of big size and increase the speed also

* HDFS Architecture

For Setup HDFS we need:-
* Java JDK 1.8
* Hadoop 2.7.3


For downloading a file from a link in RedHat as in this example we are downloading hadoop 2.7.3
```
wget http://13.234.66.67/summer19/bigdata/hadoop-2.7.3.tar.gz
```
For installing
```
sudo rpm -ivh jdk-8-linux-x64.rpm
```
For verifying
```
rpm -ql jdk
```
```
/usr/java/jdk1.8.0/bin/jps

O/P:-
1703 Jps
```
For setting PATH
```
vi /home/ec2-user/.bashrc

[input in .bashrc]
JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk1.8.0
```
For extracting the .gz file; x- extract, v- verbose, f- file, z- decompress
```
 tar -xvzf hadoop-2.7.3.tar.gz
```
renaming for short name folder
```
mv hadoop-2.7.3.tar.gz hadoop2
```
setting path
```
vi /home/ec2-user/.bashrc

[input in .bashrc]
HADOOP_HOME=/home/ec2-user/hadoop2

PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin/:$HADOOP_HOME/bin:$HADOOP_HOME/sbin:$PATH
export PATH # making it global
```
```
source /home/ec2-user/.bashrc
```
For verifying
```
jps

echo $JAVA_HOME
echo $HADOOP_HOME
```

# **Ansible**

cli :- Command Line Interface
```
sudo pip3 install awscli
```
for connectivity
```
sudo pip3 install boto3
``` 
```
pip install boto
```
for configure for credentials
```
aws configure

AWS Access Key ID [None]: _KEY_
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: _SECRET_KEY_
Default region name [None]: ap-south-1b
Default output format [None]: json
```
Default Output format types :- text, json, table

# **Redhat**
Cracking Redhat root password 7.5 or 8
add these lines which line is starting from "linux" in boot menu 

```ctrl+e```
```
enforcing=0 rd.break
```
```ctrl+x```

o= other argument
```
mount -o remount,rw /sysroot/ 

chroot /sysroot/

passwd root
```
this command updates the ```unlabeled_t``` to ```shadow_t``` for reading the root passwords
```
restorecon
```
Shadow file contains all user's passwords; Z= show security content
```
ls -ldZ /etc/shadow
```

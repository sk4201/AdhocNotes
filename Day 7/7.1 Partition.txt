If bydefault BIOS is opening in starting of Lapptop then it has MBR Partition
and UEFI -> GPT

=> lsblk                    -> List Block Devices [Partitions]

=> fdisk -l                    -> no. of harddisk attached in Linux
=> fdisk -l /dev/xvda

Smallest space in a harddisk is Sector i.e., 1 Sector = 512 Bytes
Never ever delete or format extended partition

[whole partition 30 MARKS]
Create Partitions:-

=> fdisk /dev/xvdf              -> entered into harddisk
=> print or p                   -> to check if there are partitions in this harddisk
=> new or n                     -> to create a new partition
=> wq or w                      -> saves all the process
=> q                            -> quits the whole process

Format that partition:- (NTFS - Format of Windows) (HFS+ or HPFS - Format of MAC) (XFS - Format of Redhat)
                        FAT or vfat is universal format for all OS

=> mkfs.xfs /dev/xvdf1          -> make file system; format the partition

=> mkfs. [tab tab]              -> shows all the supported format

=> df                           -> shows all the system disk usage of OS

Mount:- Create a folder and map/link the partition

In Linux, there is a directory i.e., /mnt where the external devices are mounted

mkdir /mnt/mypart
mount /dev/xvdf1 /mnt/mypart    -> mount the partition in /mnt/mypart

=> df                           -> shows the details and path where we have mounted the partition
=> df -h                        -> Human readable Format
=> df -hT                       -> Human readable and shows the format type info of partitions 

if we mount in /media, icon will be shown

for permananting the mounting storage go to /etc/fstab and add:- 
/dev/xvdf1 /mnt/mypart xfs  

=> mount -a                        -> for confirming that mounting is done successfully by the command

There are two types of storage:-
Primary
Secondary

In HDD, there is no
Partition Table decide how many partition are to created 
There are 2 types of Partition Tbale:-
MBR (Master Boot Record)
GPT (GUID(Globally Unique Identifier) Partition Table)

[In Exam] MBR:-
Maximum 2TB is seen or used, more than that it cannot access it
Maximum Memory of parrtition information is 64 bytes.
MBR can have maximum 4 Primary Partition
It can have only 1 Extended Partition and then in this it can have 60 Logical Partition
Overall 3P+1E(60L) = 64 Partition but 63 are operatable (excluding Extended)

GPT:-
Maximum 8EB is seen or used
No Logic Extended Partition
By default we can create 128 Primary Partition but it is changeable

Primary Partition:-
Primary Partition includes all the OS files

=> lsblk                -> command for disk details

fdisk -lsblk            -> l= list

ec2 = Elastic Compute Cloud
AMI = Image

Permission is all about user and target

chown code /test            -> changing the owner of test directory

chmod u+r,g-r,o-x           -> giving or removing permission from owner,group and others


Octal Number System:-

r - 4
w - 2
x - 1
none - 0

chmod 421 /check

[4] first = owner
[2] Second = group
[1] third = others

chmod 754 /check            -> 7= 4+2+1[Owner](rwx); 5= 4+1[Group](rx); 4= 4[others](r)
chmod 000 /check            -> removing all permission from owner, group and others

format of chmod:-
chmod (special permission) (Owner) (group) (others)

chmod 0777 /check           -> 0= no special permission
chmod 1777 /check           -> 1= sticky bit applied
chmod 2777 /check           -> 2= SGID applied
chmod 3777 /check           -> 3= [2+1] Sticky bit and  SGID both applied

ACL = Access Control List = giving any specific user giving different permission in a group

setfacl -m u:u4:rx /check   -> setfacl= set file access control list; m= modify; u= user; u4= username; rx=permission; /check= directory name
setfacl -m g:tech:rx /check -> for group
setfacl /check              -> to check all the permission of all the users
setfacl -x u:u4 /check      -> x= removing the permissions
getfacl /check              -> to see all the permissions

umask is a factor  which decide the by default permissions of a file or a directory

=>2*"hi"				-> Prints 'hihi'
"hello"+"hi"			-> Prints 'hellohi'

=>x=10
y=20
x+y				-> Prints 30
=>x,y=y,x				-> Swap Value
x				-> 20
y				-> 10

=>x=10
y=3.5
z="hi"
=>type(x)				-> shows the data type of x

Python does'nt take extra memory if the value is same but variable is different

=>x=20
=>id(x)				-> shows the memory id of x or 20

Datatypes:-

Immutable

Cannot change the memory id of x=10 to x=20	-> int, float, string, byte, tuple

Mutable

Can change the memory id 	-> list, set, dictionary


80% approx data is in string in world

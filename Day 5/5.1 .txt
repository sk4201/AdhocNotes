[20% marks in Redhat Certication Exam] Linux File System Security:-
Data is stored whether in:-
Folder or Directory
File

A normal user uses generally 3 operation for files or folders:-
Read				=> r		
Write				=> w
Execute = chmod -x /usr/bin/firefox	=> x; chmod= Change Mode; deny the execution permission of firefox; will not open via graphical or by terminal

inode table (Same as index table)	-> includes every file and folder information including permissions
ls -i /abc.txt			-> inode no.
ls -il /abc.txt			-> inode details
ls -ld /etc				-> for directory permission details
ls -ldi /etc				-> for directory permission details with inode no.

Changing Permissions:-
chmod [u=Owner/User; g=group; o=other]
for adding permission do '+'
for remove permission do '-'

Ex:- chmod o-r /test			-> o=other; '-' = permission remove; r=read
chmod u+rwx,g+r,o+rx /test		-> gives multiple permission to different

mkdir /project
groupadd tech
chgrp tech /project

useradd -G tech priti
useradd harry
useradd jack
usermod -G tech harry
usermod -G tech jack

		Sticky Bit		-> Advance Permission -> when having same permission in a group but cannot change data of other user's data in same group
chmod +t /project			-> t = Sticky Bit; for turning on the sticky bit

there is a folder in Linux in which everyone has permission to do anything but cannot change any other user work	-> /tmp

ls -l /project			-> shows the details of all files with their permission and user and groupname

		Set Group ID	-> shows the name of the group in ' ls -l /project '
chmod g+s /project		-> g=group; s=setgroupid


su - jack				-> switch user to jack and goes to /home/jack directory
su jack					-> switch user to jack and goes to current directory

sudo -i					-> switch to root and goes to root directory
sudo -s					-> switch to root and be on the current directory
